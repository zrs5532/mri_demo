here are some notes regarding the design.

Per discussion with Douglas, we decided to make a rigid board for the first demo.
On the board, we shall have the MCU, DAC, INA, voltage reference, and LDO.
We created another board to interface the UART to USB dongle, through Tag-connect cable: TC2030-IDC-NL.
the dongle will be located on another interfacing board.
the same tag cable can be used to program the MCU.
